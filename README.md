## Product Design

The reason using JavaScript for this game is because it allows interactivity for users to the website, for instance, implementing 
responses when buttons are pressed and clicked. Javascript is also incredibly versatile that allows animated 2D graphics to be
rendered on HTML5 Canvas that can also be be manipulated with CSS3.


## Possible Future Features
- Multiplayer where users can see who loses first
- Lives for the Duck in single player to see how long they can last
- Difficulty levels that lets user choose based on skill level
- More random sprites to choose
